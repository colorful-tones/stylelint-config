CSS Coding Standards for WordPress projects

## Dependencies

1. [Node & NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - 3rd party dependencies are managed through NPM, so you will need that installed globally
2. [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - as this is a config extention for Stylelint, you will need Stylelint installed in your main project in order for it to work.
